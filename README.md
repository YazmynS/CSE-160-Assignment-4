Notes to Grader: 
Use Mouse Control to Rotate the Scene.
Couldn't figure out Spot Light so likely gonna be a 9/10.
I kept the light on the walls and floor because I thought it was so cool how the light bounces off the floor and wall onto the bee and the sphere. It was one of the ways I tested to make sure my light was working not just from the light source but from other sources created from that source. It was also a really good way to show that the world was lit and not just the objects in the world.

I used Copilot and ChatGPT in this assignment.
